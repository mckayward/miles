# What's going on?
What's up!? I was thinking about how well you did with our intro to coding
class last night, and thought I'd put together this challenge for you.
Hopefully this will help you feel what it's like to work on code in a
real-world setting.

As you can see, I bought [milesheiner.com](https://milesheiner.com) and put up
a website that makes fun of you. It will live there into perpetuity until you
figure out how to change it!

## How to change the site
If you submit a pull request to the master branch of this repository, I will
merge it. This will trigger an automated deploy and change whatever is on
[milesheiner.com](https://milesheiner.com). Once you've successfully done that, I'll transfer the
repository, domain name, and free hosting to you. That means you'll have
control of your website and it will be free to keep on the internet.

## Don't understand what any of that means?
Well, that's the point! You're going to have to dig around, search the
internet, and figure out how to change this stuff! Being able to figure stuff
out by searching the Internet is probably the most useful skill for a software
developer to have. You will find yourself doing a lot of web searches and reading different tutorials to figure out what to do. And honestly, that's what I often find myself doing as a professional software developer.

### But seriously, where should I even start?
Okay, I will give you some hints...

1. First thing you'll need to do is get a copy of this code so you mess around with it and edit it. I suggest trying out a popular site called [repl.it](https://repl.it). It's an easy way to get coding and not have to worry about setting up your own computer to code on. Repl.it even has easy integrations with GitHub, where this code is hosted.
   - The website you're looking at right now is called GitHub. It's a place where
     developers collaborate on projects and host (a fancy word for keep) their
     source code. As you can see by scrolling around on this page, the files for
     [milesheiner.com](https://milesheiner.com) are kept here. I kept things
     pretty simple, so hopefully you'll be able to see how things fit together.
   - Check out [this repl.it article](https://docs.replit.com/tutorials/06-github-and-run-button) about how to work with GitHub to get started. You can always call me if you get too stuck. But also try searching Google and YouTube. There are a ton of resources out there!
2. After you've figured out how to get access to the code, it's time to get down to business! Look at the code and try to figure out what's going on. I used HTML, CSS, and JavaScript (JS) to create the site. No fancy frameworks or magical stuff going on. Just run-of-the-mill vanilla stuff. Try looking up basic HTML, CSS, and JS tutorials if you can't figure out what's going on. When in doubt, just mess around!
   - FYI: HTML, CSS, and JavaScript are the building blocks that behind *all* websites. They just might employ fancier and more complex ways of using those tools.
3. Once you've made some changes, submit them to me in a pull request.
   - What's a pull request? Look it up!

 ## What if I don't care to do this?
 Then don't do it. It's not homework, not required, nobody will care if you don't do it.

 But if you *do* do it, you'll get your domain name, and pick up some valuable skills along the way.

 Happy coding!
